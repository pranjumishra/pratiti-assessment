# Project Title

This project is a full-stack web application with a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application that provides the user interface for the project.

### Technologies Used

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for designing responsive and mobile-first websites.

    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend is a Node.js application built with the Express framework. It provides a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.

### Technologies Used

*   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
